# BrailleBox

## Rough overview
I created this through a passion for helping the visually impaired. During Hack the North 2019, I was incredibly interested in how visually impaired people lived their daily lives, and through this interest I found a hole in my assumptions. I had always assumed that _most_ visually impaired people knew Braille, however as it turns out, this is not true. I don't recall the exact statistic, but a surprising amount of visually impaired people do not receive a good enough education on Braille to be able to use it effectively. Instead, they rely on technologies like text to speech and cameras that can read aloud what they are pointing towards.

While there is nothing wrong with using other technologies, the lack of Braille education was worrisome to me, and so I decided to create a very cheap device using an Arduino that could convert text to braille characters. This was to both help visually impaired people learn braile, as well as create a basis for cheap braille readers for those that prefer braille over text to speech when reading.

This was made using **C++ and Arduino**
